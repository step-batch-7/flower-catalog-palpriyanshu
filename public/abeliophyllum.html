          <strong>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf) </strong>is a monotypic
          genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists
          of one species, <strong>Abeliophyllum distichum </strong>Nakai, endemic to Korea, where
          it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is
          related to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not yellow,
          flowers.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are
          opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent both
          above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring before the
          new leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with
          a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm
          diameter. 
          <p>
          It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North
          America.
